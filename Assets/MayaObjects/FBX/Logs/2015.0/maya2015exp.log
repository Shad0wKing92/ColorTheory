2015-04-28 16:14:43: LOG: [WARNING] Geometry conversion - Because the 'Split per-vertex Normals' option is activated, some vertices on exported geometries were 
	duplicated so that the correct number of normals are defined. To keep the original 
	number of vertices with the geometry, disable this option. 
	Note: Hard edges and smoothing groups are also lost.
